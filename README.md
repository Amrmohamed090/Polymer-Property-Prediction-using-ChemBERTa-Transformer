# Polymer Property Prediction using ChemBERTa Transformer

This project applies **Deep Learning** and **Chemoinformatics** to establish a Structure-Property Relationship (SPR) for polymers. It leverages a Transformer-based Language Model to predict crucial physical properties directly from their chemical structures.
